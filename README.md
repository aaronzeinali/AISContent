Sleep is essential for rest and recovery. The brain moves through stages: wakefulness (Stage 0), light sleep (Stage 1), deep sleep (Stages 2-3), and REM (Stage 4). These stages support learning, memory, and health. This competition focuses on developing AI to detect sleep stages from ear-recorded EEG data.
